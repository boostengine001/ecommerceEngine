/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (carts, orders, user profiles) and allows public read access to product information.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product information.
 *  - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only to the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/cart: The user's shopping cart, accessible only to the user. CartId is the same as userId.
 *  - /users/{userId}/cart/cartItems/{cartItemId}: Items within the user's cart, accessible only to the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: User's order history, accessible only to the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/orderItems/{orderItemId}: Items within a specific order, accessible only to the user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User data is strictly segregated under /users/{userId} to enforce ownership.
 *  - Products are publicly readable but writable only through backend processes (not implemented in this ruleset).
 *  - List operations on user-owned collections are restricted to the owning user.
 *  - The rules explicitly deny any unauthorized access, defaulting to a secure posture.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization No denormalization is required, as ownership is determined by the Firestore path.
 * @structuralSegregation Public product data is stored separately from private user data.
